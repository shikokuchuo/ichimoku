Description: An implementation of 'Ichimoku Kinko Hyo', also commonly
    known as 'cloud charts'. Static and interactive visualizations with
    tools for creating, backtesting and development of quantitative
    'ichimoku' strategies.  As described in Sasaki (1996,
    ISBN:4925152009), the technique is a refinement on candlestick
    charting, originating from Japan and now in widespread use in
    technical analysis worldwide. Translating as 'one-glance equilibrium
    chart', it allows the price action and market structure of financial
    securities to be determined 'at-a-glance'. Incorporates an interface
    with the OANDA fxTrade API <https://developer.oanda.com/> for
    retrieving historical and live streaming price data for major
    currencies, metals, commodities, government bonds and stock indices.
