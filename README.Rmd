An implementation of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo charting technique, also commonly known as 'cloud charts' in R. Translating to 'one-glance equilibrium chart', it allows the price action and market structure of financial securities to be determined 'at-a-glance'. This R package contains functions to compute and plot both static and interactive ichimoku cloud charts.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ichimoku from [Github](https://github.com/shikokuchuo/ichimoku/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("shikokuchuo/ichimoku")
```

## Example

Example based on synthetic data:

```{r loaddata, echo = FALSE}
# Sample synthetic data
data <- data.frame(
